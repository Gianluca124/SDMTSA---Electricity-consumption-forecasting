## Abstract

In this project, different models are being tested for forecasting a time series of energy consumption. ARIMA, UCM, and machine learning models are being implemented with the objective of identifying the best solution for predicting the data for the month of December.

## Pre-processing

### Step 1. Download and extract the dataset

Download the dataset from the [official Kaggle Folder](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/electric-power-consumption). This project was carried out with only the time series of consumption available: the other variables were hidden, as well as the data for the month of December. Implementing the other attributes present in the dataset is a possible way to improve the results obtained.

### Step 2. Exploratory analysis
Perform all the necessary pre-processing steps using `Preprocessing.ipynb` notebook.

## Classification

In the `Classification.ipynb` notebook both binary and multi-class classification are performed. For both tasks several algorithm are proposed.


## Clustering

In the `Clustering.ipynb` notebook the clustering task is proposed via K-Means clustering and Agglomerative Clustering.


## Results

Check out the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1veNClNl7CxCTFHVNY2Fp29hcMoEj-the) with all the trained models and results.

## Status

 Project is: ![##c5f015](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c5f015/000000?text=+)  _Done_
